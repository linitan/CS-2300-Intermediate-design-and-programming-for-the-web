Arrivial-Denis Villeneuve-fiction-Arrival is a smart tale of alien contact that boasts great visuals and performances, if also more brains than heart.
Fence-Denzel Washington-fiction-"Fences" has passages of fierce and moving power, but on screen the play comes off as episodic and more than a bit unwieldy.
Hacksaw Ridge-Mel Gibson-Action-The film pretends to be a grim reckoning with the horrors of war, but it is also, true to its genre, a rousing celebration of the thrills of battle.
La la land-Damien Chazelle-Romance-The real tension in “La La Land” is between ambition and love, and perhaps the most up-to-date thing about it is the way it explores that ancient conflict.
Zootopia-Byron Howard-Animation-Clever and heartwarming, this animated adventure is equal parts buddy-cop comedy, fish-out-of-water tale, and whodunit mystery.
